**A command-line-tool to generate stong and flexible passwords with a secure, local storage system for multiple users.

This project started as a personal challenge to build a useful tool entirely from scratch. My goal was to move beyond following step-by-step video tutorials and instead rely on my own problem-solving skills, using official documentation and focused research to overcome obstacles. Everything you see here, from the application's architecture to the user interface, is my own work—the result of curiosity and a lot of trial-and-error.
